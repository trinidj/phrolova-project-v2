## Normal Attack: Half Truths

**Basic Attack**

Aalto fires up to 5 consecutive shots, dealing Aero DMG. Basic Attack 4 will spread the "Mist" forward, which lasts for 1.5s.

**Heavy Attack**

Aalto enters the aiming state for a more powerful shot. The aimed shot fired after charging finishes deals Aero DMG.

**Mid-air Attack**

Aalto consumes Stamina to perform consecutive shots at the target in mid-air, dealing Aero DMG.

**Dodge Counter**

Use Basic Attack after a successful Dodge to attack the target, dealing Aero DMG.

## Resonance Skill: Shift Trick

**Mist Avatar**

## Forte Circuit: Misty Cover

When Aalto passes through "Mist" or "Gate of Quandary", he enters "Mistcloak Dash".

**Mistcloak Dash**

Movement speed increased; During this period, "Mist Drops" are continuously consumed, and for each 1 "Mist Drop" consumed, 1 Resonance Skill Mist Missile is generated.

**Mist Drops**

Aalto can hold up to 6 Mist Drops. When Basic Attack or Mid-air Attack passes through "Mist" and hits the target, 1 "Mist Drop" is recovered.
